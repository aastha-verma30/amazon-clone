Amazon Clone (HTML/CSS Only)
This is a basic Amazon clone built using only HTML and CSS. It mimics the layout and design of the popular e-commerce website, showcasing the use of modern web design techniques such as responsive design, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. The project is purely front-end with no backend functionality.
